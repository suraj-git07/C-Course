// STL Containers

/*
(Types of Containers):-

1. Sequence Containers    (Stores Data in Linear Fashion)         Examples: Vector , List , dequeue           

2. Associative Conntainers      (Direct accsess)                   Examples: Set , Mulitiset , Map , Multimap

3. Derived Containers          (Real world Modelling)             Examples: Stack , Queue , Priority Queue


(When To Use Which?)

//Sequence Containers//

1. Vectors     
               Random access is Fast (as compared to array)
               INser/Del in Middle is Slow
               INser/Del in End is Fast
               
2. List
               Random access is Slow (as compared to array)
               INser/Del in Middle is Fast
               INser/Del in End is Fast


//Associative Containers//
               
All Operations are fast Except Random Access

//Derived Containers//

Depends on Data Structure
